We can\u0026rsquo;t do this by home make script and tools. So we need a container Orchestration tool. That is Kubernetes which offers the following features.\nHigh Availability or no downtime. Scalability or high performance. Disaster recovery - backup and restore. Components Pod Service Ingress Volumes StatefulSet Deployment ConfigMap Secrets Concepts Node Physical or virtual machine Pod Smallest unit of K8S. A layer of abstraction on containers. Pod can have many container(e.g. sidecar). No need to interact with specific container tech. (e.g. docker) Only interact with kubernetes layer. Each pod gets its own IP address. New IP address on re-creation. Container Isolated runtime environment. Tech: Docker/Podman/CRI-O/LXC. Service Permanent IP address (Endpoint). Pods communicate with each other using a service. Lifecycle of Pod and Service Not connected. Pod die, Service stay. Pod load balancer. Ingress Route traffic into cluster(Internal Service). ConfigMap External config of your application. Secret Used to store secret data. Base64 encoded. Volumes Data persistence of pod. Mount a physical storage to the pod. Replica Exist on other node connect to the same service. Deployment A layer of abstraction on pods. Stateless applications. Blueprint for app pods. Specify the replica numbers. Can\u0026rsquo;t replicate database because it\u0026rsquo;s stateful. StatefulSet For stateful apps like MySQL, Elasticsearch.
